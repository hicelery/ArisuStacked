# ArisuStacked
CAD files and firmware for a stacked acrylic arisu keyboard.

These files are based on FateNozomi's open source stacked alice case, with some minor tweaks for usability. 
This repo does not contain pcb manufacturing files nor BOM, and the user is highly encouraged to read the original source material.

The changes made are as follows:
Support for 2u Backspace.
Support for Step-caps.
Flex cuts to acrylic plate.
Removed redundant pieces from top files.

These files contain both copies of the undercase supports/angles
Note that if you want to use the full stack of 4 angle pieces, 4 M2.5 x 18mm bolts will replace 4 of the M2.5 x 12mm bolts.
